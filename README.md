# WSI - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

In this repository there are all my projects during WSI (intro to ai) lectures. In repository you can find jupyter notebooks of such projects:

### I. <a href="https://github.com/lukasz-staniszewski/ai-intro/blob/dev/task%201%20-%20Newton%20method%20in%20optimazation/lab1-wsi.ipynb"> NEWTON'S METHOD FOR FUNCTION MAXIMAZATION.</a>
For given objective functions Newton's method makes optimazation and finds maximum of function.

### II. <a href="https://github.com/lukasz-staniszewski/ai-intro/blob/dev/task%202%20-%20evolution%20algorithm/lab2-wsi.ipynb"> EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM FOR FUNCTION OPTIMAZATION. </a>
Implementation of evolutionary algorithm without breeding with tournament selection and elite succession to find maximum and minimum of given functions. 

### III. <a href="https://github.com/lukasz-staniszewski/ai-intro/blob/dev/task%203%20-%20MiniMax%20algorithm%20with%20TicTacToe/lab3-wsi.ipynb"> MINIMAX ALGORITHM WITH TIC-TAC-TOE GAME</a>
